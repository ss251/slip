# Gotchas & Hard-Won Learnings

Compiler findings and pitfalls discovered through real Discord conversations
and community experience with Midnight development. Every item here has been
confirmed by compilation error, runtime failure, or developer frustration.

---

## Compiler Gotchas

### 1. `ledger { }` block syntax is dead

The block-style ledger declaration was removed. It causes a parse error.

```compact
// BAD — parse error
ledger {
  counter: Counter;
  owner: Bytes<32>;
}

// GOOD — individual declarations
export ledger counter: Counter;
export ledger owner: Bytes<32>;
```

Each ledger variable must be declared separately with its own `export ledger`
statement. This was a syntax change that is not reflected in older tutorials.

### 2. `Void` does not exist

Compact has no `Void` type. The unit return type is an empty tuple.

```compact
// BAD — unknown type
export circuit doSomething(): Void { }

// GOOD — empty tuple
export circuit doSomething(): [] { }
```

> **NOTE:** This catches many developers coming from Rust, TypeScript, or Java
> where `void`/`Void` is standard. In Compact, `[]` is the zero-element tuple
> and serves the same purpose.

### 3. `function` keyword does not exist

There is no `function` keyword in Compact. Helper functions that do not touch
the ledger are declared as `pure circuit`.

```compact
// BAD — parse error
function helper(x: Field): Field { return x + 1; }

// GOOD — pure circuit for off-ledger helpers
pure circuit helper(x: Field): Field { return x + 1; }
```

`circuit` accesses ledger state. `pure circuit` is a pure computation with no
ledger access and no side effects.

### 4. Enum dot notation, not double colon

Compact uses dot notation for enum variants, not Rust-style `::`.

```compact
// BAD — parse error (Rust-style)
Choice::rock

// GOOD — dot notation
Choice.rock
```

This is one of the most common errors for developers with Rust experience.

### 5. `counter.value()` does not exist

Ledger state is read with `.read()`, not `.value()`.

```compact
// BAD — no such method
const val = counter.value();

// GOOD
const val = counter.read();
```

### 6. Dynamic vector indexing not supported

Vector indexing must use compile-time literal indices. Variable indices are
a parse error.

```compact
// BAD — parse error
const item = my_vector[variable];

// GOOD — literal index only
const item = my_vector[2];
```

> **WARNING:** If you need dynamic access into a vector, you must use `fold`
> to iterate through elements and match on position. There is no workaround
> that allows runtime-computed indices.

### 7. Map cannot be a witness type

Maps are ledger-only types. They cannot cross the witness boundary.

```compact
// BAD — witness cannot return Map
witness getMap(): Map<K, V>;

// GOOD — pass individual key-value pairs through witnesses
witness getKey(): K;
witness getValue(): V;
```

Structure your circuit to accept individual values from witnesses and
reconstruct or update map state on the ledger side.

### 8. Hashing Opaque types crashes the compiler

Passing an `Opaque` type to `persistentHash` causes a Rust panic in the
Compact compiler. This is not a graceful error — the compiler crashes.

```compact
// BAD — compiler error in 0.30.0+ (was a crash in earlier versions)
const h = persistentHash<Opaque<"string">>(name);

// GOOD — convert to Bytes<N> before hashing
const h = persistentHash<Bytes<32>>(nameAsBytes);
```

> **WARNING:** This is a compiler bug, not a user error. If you need to hash
> string-like data, convert it to `Bytes<N>` first, or use a witness to
> perform the hashing off-chain and pass the hash in.

### 9. No mod operator

Compact has no modulo operator (`%`, `mod`). Attempting to use one fails.
Worse, using cast to truncate as a workaround can trigger another Rust panic.

```compact
// BAD — no mod operator
const r = x % 2;
const r = x mod 2;

// GOOD — compute modulo in witness, verify in circuit
witness getRemainder(dividend: Field, divisor: Field): Field;

// In circuit:
const remainder = getRemainder(x, 2);
const quotient = (x - remainder) / 2;
assert(quotient * 2 + remainder == x);
assert(remainder < 2);
```

> **TIP:** The pattern is: compute the answer off-chain in a witness, then
> verify the mathematical relationship in-circuit. This is a common ZK
> idiom — verification is cheaper than computation.

### 10. Bytes indexing not supported

You cannot index individual bytes of a `Bytes<N>` value, nor convert
`Bytes<N>` to `Vector<N, Uint<8>>`.

```compact
// BAD — not supported
const firstByte = myBytes[0];
const vec: Vector<32, Uint<8>> = bytesToVector(myBytes);
```

> **NOTE:** This is a planned feature. Until it lands, structure your data
> as `Vector<N, Uint<8>>` from the start if you need per-byte access.

### 11. Vectors are immutable

You cannot update individual elements of a Vector. There is no subscript
assignment.

```compact
// BAD — cannot assign to vector element
my_vector[2] = newValue;

// GOOD — reconstruct the entire vector
// Struct spread syntax exists but NOT vector spread
```

If you need mutable collection semantics, consider using ledger `Map` or
restructuring so each element is a separate ledger variable.

### 12. Field arithmetic overflow

`Field` addition and multiplication do NOT perform modular arithmetic.
Adding values near `MAX_FIELD` returns an out-of-bounds bigint rather than
wrapping.

```compact
// DANGER — does not wrap, produces invalid bigint
const result = maxFieldValue + 1;
```

> **WARNING:** This is a known bug. Sergey (Midnight team) confirmed in
> April 2025 that it is "going to be fixed soon." Until then, use `Field`
> arithmetic with extreme caution and validate ranges manually if operating
> near field boundaries.

### 13. No signature verification in-circuit

Compact circuits cannot verify cryptographic signatures. There are no
built-in functions for Ed25519, ECDSA, or any signature scheme.

> **NOTE:** This needs either native Compact support or bigger integer
> operations to implement. It is not currently on a published timeline.
> Design around this by verifying signatures off-chain and passing results
> through witnesses, or by using ledger-level authorization patterns.

### 14. Iterating over dynamic List in circuit is impossible

`List` is a dynamic-sized ledger ADT. Attempting to loop over it in a
circuit fails with "incomplete chain of ledger indirects."

```compact
// BAD — runtime error
for (const item of myList) { ... }

// GOOD — use fixed-size Vector<N, T>
export ledger items: Vector<10, Item>;

// OR — process items individually via separate circuit calls
// Iterate off-chain, call a circuit per item
```

> **TIP:** The general pattern for unbounded collections is: keep a `List`
> on the ledger, but iterate over it off-chain in TypeScript. For each item,
> call a circuit that processes a single element. This is more gas-expensive
> but avoids the compiler limitation.

---

## SDK / Tooling Gotchas

### 15. ESM/CJS module conflicts

Midnight packages are ESM-only. Using them in a CommonJS project causes
`ERR_REQUIRE_ESM`.

```json
// package.json — REQUIRED
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

> **TIP:** Use Node.js 22+ for best ESM support. Ensure all imports use
> ESM syntax (`import`, not `require`). If you must support CJS consumers,
> use dynamic `import()`.

### 16. Buffer polyfill required in browser

Browser environments lack Node.js `Buffer`. Midnight SDK functions that
call `toHex` will throw.

```typescript
// Add early in app initialization (e.g., main.ts or index.ts)
import { Buffer } from 'buffer';
globalThis.Buffer = Buffer;
```

> **NOTE:** This must execute before any Midnight SDK import that touches
> `Buffer`. Put it at the very top of your entry point.

### 17. WebSocket polyfill required for Node.js tests

Node.js test environments may lack a global WebSocket.

```typescript
// Add to test setup file
import { WebSocket } from 'ws';
globalThis.WebSocket = WebSocket;
```

This is typically needed when running integration tests against indexer
or proof server endpoints from Node.js.

### 18. Vite requires special plugins

Midnight's WASM modules will not load in a default Vite configuration.

```bash
npm install vite-plugin-wasm vite-plugin-top-level-await @originjs/vite-plugin-commonjs
```

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
import wasm from 'vite-plugin-wasm';
import topLevelAwait from 'vite-plugin-top-level-await';
import commonjs from '@originjs/vite-plugin-commonjs';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [wasm(), topLevelAwait(), commonjs()],
  build: {
    target: 'esnext',  // REQUIRED — must be esnext
  },
});
```

> **WARNING:** The build target MUST be `esnext`. Lower targets (e.g.,
> `es2020`) will fail to handle top-level await in WASM modules.

### 19. First compile downloads ~500MB of ZK parameters

The first `compact compile` invocation downloads BLS ZK parameters from S3.
This can take a long time and may timeout on slow connections.

> **TIP:** Use the Brick Towers pre-baked proof server which includes
> parameters in the Docker image. This eliminates the download step entirely.
> Alternatively, retry with a stable network connection — the download
> resumes where it left off.

### 20. Dev tools vs toolchain update order matters

Updating in the wrong order breaks the toolchain.

```bash
# WRONG ORDER — can break installation
compact update 0.28.0
compact self update

# CORRECT ORDER — always update dev tools first
compact self update          # 1. Update the CLI itself
compact update 0.28.0        # 2. THEN update the toolchain version
```

> **WARNING:** If you run `compact update` before `compact self update`,
> the older CLI may not understand the newer toolchain format. Always
> update the CLI first, then the toolchain.

---

## Proof Server Gotchas

### 21. Docker command quoting

The `--network` flag in docker-compose requires careful quoting.

```yaml
# BAD — flag not recognized
command: midnight-proof-server --network testnet

# GOOD — wrap entire command in single quotes
command: "'midnight-proof-server --network testnet'"
```

This is a Docker/shell escaping issue, not a proof server issue.

### 22. 400 Bad Request with no useful error

A proof server returning 400 on valid-looking requests almost always means
a version mismatch.

**Cause:** The compiled contract was built with a different Compact toolchain
version than the proof server expects.

**Fix:** Align all versions per the Midnight compatibility matrix:
- Compact compiler version
- Proof server version
- SDK version
- Indexer version

> **TIP:** The Midnight team publishes a compatibility matrix with each
> release. Check it before mixing versions. A single version mismatch
> between any two components can cause silent 400 errors.

### 23. Proof server timeout on complex circuits

Circuits with constraint count k=17 or higher can exceed proof generation
time. The proof server may silently hang without returning an error.

**Fixes:**
- Optimize circuit complexity — reduce the number of constraints
- Inline circuits where possible to reduce overhead
- Use Brick Towers pre-baked proof server (better optimized)
- Increase server timeout configuration if available

> **WARNING:** A silently hanging proof server looks identical to a network
> issue from the client's perspective. Add client-side timeouts and logging
> to detect this.

### 24. BLS parameter download failures

The proof server downloads BLS parameters from S3 on first start. This
can fail after 3 attempts with no recovery.

**Fixes:**
- Pre-bake parameters into the Docker image
- Retry with a more stable network connection
- Host parameters locally and point the proof server at your mirror

**Corporate proxies:** The Compact compiler also downloads ZK parameters from AWS S3 on first compile. Corporate proxies or firewalls may block these downloads. If `compact compile` fails with "Failed to fetch data from ...s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com... after 3 attempts":
- Ensure the proxy allows `*.amazonaws.com` on port 443
- Or bypass the proxy for the compile step: `unset http_proxy https_proxy && compact compile ...`
- Or use the [Brick Towers pre-baked proof server](https://github.com/bricktowers/midnight-proof-server) which includes parameters

### 25. "Failed direct assertion" in proof server

Stack trace through `midnight_base_crypto::proofs::ir_vm` means a Compact
`assert()` statement evaluated to false during proof generation.

```
// The error looks like:
// Failed direct assertion
// at midnight_base_crypto::proofs::ir_vm::...
```

**This is NOT a proof server bug.** Your private inputs (witnesses) do not
satisfy one of the circuit's assertions. Debug the assertion condition by
checking what values the witnesses are returning.

> **TIP:** Add logging in your witness functions to see what values are
> being passed to the circuit. The assertion that fails is somewhere in
> your Compact code — the stack trace does not tell you which one.

---

## Wallet / Deployment Gotchas

### 26. Lace wallet broken for 13+ circuits

When a contract has 13 or more circuits, the Lace wallet's
dapp-connector-api version mismatches with ledger-v7, causing failures.

> **NOTE:** A fix is expected in a future Lace release. Until then, use
> the JavaScript wallet SDK directly as a workaround for contracts with
> many circuits.

### 27. Windows is NOT supported

The Midnight toolchain does not work on Windows. This is not a "might not
work" — it is explicitly unsupported.

**Supported platforms:**
- Linux (x86_64)
- macOS (x86_64 and ARM)

> **NOTE:** WSL2 may work but is not officially supported. If you must
> develop on Windows, use a Linux VM or WSL2 and accept the risk of
> edge-case failures.

### 28. Wallet sync is slow

Initial wallet sync scans the entire chain. At 35,000+ indices scanning
at approximately 10 per second, this takes a long time.

```typescript
// Use the waitForFunds() pattern to avoid polling
await wallet.waitForFunds(expectedAmount);
```

> **TIP:** This only needs to happen once per wallet. Subsequent syncs
> are incremental. Future SDK versions will optimize initial sync.

### 29. DUST locked on transaction failure

Failed transactions can leave DUST tokens locked in the wallet, rendering
them unusable until the wallet is restarted.

> **WARNING:** This is a known SDK issue. If you notice your available
> balance decreasing after failed transactions, restart the wallet to
> unlock the stuck DUST.

### 30. Native token type mismatch

`nativeToken()` and `unshieldedToken().raw` return different-length hex
strings. Balance lookups that mix the two fail silently.

```typescript
// nativeToken() returns 68-char hex
const a = nativeToken();           // 68 chars

// unshieldedToken().raw returns 64-char hex
const b = unshieldedToken().raw;   // 64 chars

// BAD — silent mismatch, balance lookups return 0
if (a === b) { /* never true */ }

// GOOD — pick one and use it consistently throughout
const tokenType = nativeToken();   // Use everywhere
```

> **WARNING:** This fails silently. Your balance query returns 0 instead
> of throwing an error. If balances seem wrong, check token type string
> lengths first.

### 31. LevelDB LEVEL_LOCKED error

Two processes cannot open the same LevelDB folder simultaneously.

```typescript
// BAD — two instances on same folder
const provider1 = levelDbPrivateStateProvider('./state');
const provider2 = levelDbPrivateStateProvider('./state');  // LEVEL_LOCKED

// GOOD — separate folders for multi-user testing
const provider1 = levelDbPrivateStateProvider('./state-user1');
const provider2 = levelDbPrivateStateProvider('./state-user2');

// OR — use in-memory provider for tests
const provider = inMemoryPrivateStateProvider();
```

### 32. Verifier keys must be copied to web dist

dApp builds will fail at runtime if the keys and zkir directories from the
contract compilation output are not present in the web distribution folder.

```bash
# Add to your build script
cp -r ../contract/dist/managed/mycontract/keys ./dist/keys
cp -r ../contract/dist/managed/mycontract/zkir ./dist/zkir
```

> **TIP:** Add this to your build pipeline (e.g., a `postbuild` script in
> package.json) so it cannot be forgotten. Missing keys cause cryptic
> runtime errors that are hard to trace back to this step.

### 33. No block number or timestamp in Compact

Compact circuits have no built-in access to block height or wall clock time.

```compact
// BAD — no such built-in
const blockHeight = getCurrentBlock();
const now = getCurrentTime();

// GOOD — use a witness to pass time from TypeScript
witness getCurrentTime(): Uint<64>;
```

```typescript
// In your witness implementation
witnesses: {
  getCurrentTime: () => BigInt(Date.now()),
}
```

> **NOTE:** Newer versions of the SDK provide `blockTimeGte`/`blockTimeLt`
> (see gotcha #65) for protocol-enforced time-based conditions. Prefer these
> over a witness-based time solution — they cannot be spoofed by callers.

### 34. No direct cross-contract function calls

A deployed Compact contract cannot directly call functions on another deployed contract. Each
contract is isolated at the function-call level.

> **NOTE:** For commitment-based cross-contract interaction, see gotcha #68 (`kernel.claimContractCall`).
> Until direct calls are supported, orchestrate multi-contract interactions off-chain
> by composing transactions in TypeScript that interact with multiple
> contracts sequentially.

### 35. DApp Connector API does not expose transfer

You cannot perform simple token transfers through the dapp-connector-api.
Even basic "send DUST from A to B" requires a circuit.

```compact
// You must build a circuit that performs the transfer
export circuit transfer(to: Bytes<32>, amount: Uint<64>): [] {
  // ... transfer logic ...
}
```

> **TIP:** This means every token operation, no matter how simple, requires
> a compiled circuit and proof generation. Plan your contract's circuit
> surface area accordingly — include basic transfer circuits even if they
> seem trivial.

## SDK / Runtime Gotchas (Compiler-Validated)

The following gotchas were discovered by compiling and testing skill examples against
Compact compiler 0.29.0 and `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime`.

### 36. `createCircuitContext` takes 4 parameters, not 2

The signature is `createCircuitContext(contractAddress, zswapLocalState, contractState, privateState)`.
Passing only `(contractState, privateState)` throws `'contractState' parameter undefined has unexpected type`.

```typescript
// BAD — only 2 params
const ctx = createCircuitContext(contractState, privateState);

// GOOD — all 4 params
const addr = sampleContractAddress();
const ctx = createCircuitContext(
  addr,
  initial.currentZswapLocalState,
  initial.currentContractState,
  initial.currentPrivateState
);
```

### 37. `sampleContractAddress` is a function

It must be called with `()`. Passing it as a value gives a function object, not an address.

```typescript
// BAD — passes a function object
createConstructorContext({}, sampleContractAddress);

// GOOD — calls the function
createConstructorContext({}, sampleContractAddress());
```

### 38. Circuit results use context continuation, not state destructuring

After executing a circuit, `result.context` is the full continuation to pass to the
next call. Do NOT try to destructure and rebuild — pass it directly.

```typescript
// BAD — contractState from result.context.currentQueryContext is QueryContext, not ContractState
const ctx2 = createCircuitContext(addr, result.context.currentZswapLocalState,
  result.context.currentQueryContext, result.context.currentPrivateState);

// GOOD — pass result.context directly as the next circuit's context
const r2 = contract.impureCircuits.read(result.context);
```

### 39. `ledger()` helper expects ContractState, not QueryContext

The generated `ledger()` function needs the original `ContractState` (from `initialState()`),
not the `QueryContext` (from `result.context.currentQueryContext`). Use `read` circuits
for checking ledger values in simulator tests.

### 40. *(Merged into #24)*

### 41. `Opaque<"string">` values cannot be constructed in-circuit

String literals like `""` have type `Bytes<0>`, not `Opaque<"string">`. Attempting
to assign a string literal to an `Opaque<"string">` ledger field causes:
`expected right-hand side of = to have type Opaque<"string"> but received Bytes<0>`.

Opaque values must come from circuit parameters or witnesses — they cannot be created
inside circuit code.

```compact
// BAD — string literal is Bytes<0>, not Opaque<"string">
message = "";

// GOOD — receive as parameter, it comes from TypeScript as a string
export circuit post(newMessage: Opaque<"string">): [] {
  message = disclose(newMessage);
}
```

### 42. Circuit parameters need `disclose()` when written to public ledger

Any value written to `export ledger` must be wrapped in `disclose()` if the compiler
considers it potentially witness-derived. This includes **circuit parameters**, even
though they come from the caller, because the compiler cannot prove they don't carry
witness data. Error: `potential witness-value disclosure must be declared`.

```compact
// BAD — compiler rejects: parameter could be witness-derived
export circuit post(msg: Opaque<"string">): [] {
  message = msg;
}

// GOOD — explicitly acknowledge disclosure
export circuit post(msg: Opaque<"string">): [] {
  message = disclose(msg);
}
```

### 43. Multi-user testing: separate Contract instances, shared context chain

To test multi-user scenarios in the simulator, create separate `Contract` instances
with different witness implementations. All share the same context chain.

```typescript
const aliceContract = new Contract(makeWitnesses(aliceKey));
const bobContract = new Contract(makeWitnesses(bobKey));

// Alice posts, context continues...
const r1 = aliceContract.impureCircuits.post(ctx, "Hello");
// Bob operates on the same context chain
const r2 = bobContract.impureCircuits.takeDown(r1.context); // throws if Bob isn't owner
```

### 44. Module ledger state is NOT re-exported by the consuming contract

When you `import "./FungibleToken" prefix FT_`, the module's `export ledger`
declarations are managed internally by the compiler. The consuming contract's
compiled `Ledger` type will be `{}`. Do NOT manually declare `export ledger FT_balances: ...`
in your contract — this creates a duplicate field, not a re-export.

Access module state through circuits (`balanceOf()`, `totalSupply()`) rather than
direct ledger reads.

### 45. OZ module circuit names have underscores you might not expect

- `Ownable_assertOnlyOwner()` not `Ownable_assertOwner()`
- `Pausable__pause()` not `Pausable_pause()` (double underscore — prefix `Pausable_` + internal `_pause`)
- `FT__mint()` not `FT_mint()` (prefix `FT_` + internal `_mint`)

Always check the module source for exact circuit names.

### 46. Constructor args are separate from `ConstructorContext`

For contracts with constructor parameters, `initialState()` takes the context
first, then each constructor parameter as a separate argument:

```typescript
// BAD — trying to pack args into context
contract.initialState(createConstructorContext({ initOwner, name }, addr));

// GOOD — constructor args follow the context
contract.initialState(
  createConstructorContext({}, ownerPK),
  initOwner,      // first constructor param
  "TokenName",    // second constructor param
  "TN",           // third constructor param
  18n,            // fourth constructor param
  1000000n,       // fifth constructor param
);
```

### 47. `createConstructorContext` second param sets `ownPublicKey()` identity

For Ownable contracts, the coin public key passed to `createConstructorContext`
determines what `ownPublicKey()` returns inside circuits. This must match
the `initOwner` value or ownership checks will fail.

```typescript
// The ownerEither.left is the ZswapCoinPublicKey portion
createConstructorContext({}, ownerEither.left)
```

### 48. `Either` types require encoded byte values, not raw Uint8Array

Raw `new Uint8Array(32)` won't work as an `Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>`.
Use `encodeCoinPublicKey()` from compact-runtime or the OZ test utilities:

```typescript
import { encodeCoinPublicKey } from "@midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime";

// OZ utility (recommended)
const [, ownerEither] = utils.generateEitherPubKeyPair("OWNER");

// Manual construction
const pk = { bytes: encodeCoinPublicKey(hexString) };
const either = { is_left: true, left: pk, right: emptyAddr };
```

### 49. `Uint<N> + literal` produces a wider type that exceeds `Uint<N>`

Adding a literal to a typed integer widens the result type beyond the original bounds.
`Uint<32> + 1` produces `Uint<0..4294967297>`, which does not fit back into `Uint<32>`.
This breaks Map inserts and ledger assignments.

```compact
// BAD — type error: expected Uint<32> but received Uint<0..4294967297>
const current = approvalCounts.lookup(disclose(operationId));
approvalCounts.insert(disclose(operationId), current + 1);

// GOOD — explicit downcast
approvalCounts.insert(disclose(operationId), (current + 1) as Uint<32>);
```

> **TIP:** This applies to any arithmetic on typed integers stored in Maps or
> assigned to ledger fields. Always cast the result back to the expected type.
> Also applies to subtraction, multiplication, etc. — any arithmetic can widen.

### 50. No sequence counter for contracts with registered key sets

Contracts that maintain a set of registered keys (multi-sig signers, ACL role
members, oracle addresses) must NOT use sequence counters in key derivation.
A `sequence.increment()` call would invalidate ALL registered keys, since keys
are derived from `hash(domain || sequence || secretKey)`.

```compact
// BAD — sequence increment invalidates all registered signer keys
export pure circuit publicKey(sk: Bytes<32>, seq: Bytes<32>): Bytes<32> {
  return persistentHash<Vector<3, Bytes<32>>>([pad(32, "pk:"), seq, sk]);
}

// GOOD — deterministic keys, no sequence dependency
export pure circuit publicKey(sk: Bytes<32>): Bytes<32> {
  return persistentHash<Vector<2, Bytes<32>>>([pad(32, "pk:"), sk]);
}
```

> **WARNING:** This is a design-level gotcha, not a compiler error. The contract
> will compile and appear to work, but any state-changing operation that bumps the
> sequence will silently break all role/signer checks. Contracts affected:
> multi-sig, access control, oracle, identity proof — any pattern with registered
> key sets.

### 51. Parameterized witnesses pass circuit arguments correctly

`witness getAttributeValue(attrName: Bytes<32>): Uint<64>` is valid Compact syntax.
The parameter from the circuit is passed to the TypeScript witness function as the
second argument, after `WitnessContext`.

```compact
// Compact declaration
witness getAttributeValue(attrName: Bytes<32>): Uint<64>;

// Usage in circuit
const value = getAttributeValue(someAttrName);
```

```typescript
// TypeScript implementation — attrName arrives as second arg
getAttributeValue: (
  { privateState }: WitnessContext<Ledger, PS>,
  attrName: Uint8Array,  // circuit parameter arrives here
): [PS, bigint] => {
  const name = new TextDecoder().decode(attrName).replace(/\0+$/g, '');
  return [privateState, privateState.attributes[name] ?? 0n];
},
```

> **NOTE:** This is documented here because the feature is not well-documented
> in official resources but works correctly in Compact 0.29.0.

### 52. Internal `circuit` (non-export) CAN access export ledger

Non-exported `circuit` declarations can read and write `export ledger` state.
Only `pure circuit` is restricted from ledger access. This enables reusable
internal guard circuits.

```compact
// Internal circuit — NOT exported, but CAN access ledger
circuit assertRole(role: Bytes<32>): Bytes<32> {
  const caller = publicKey(localSecretKey());
  const key = roleKey(role, caller);
  assert(roleMembers.member(disclose(key)), "Missing required role");
  return caller;
}
```

> **NOTE:** `pure circuit` = no ledger access, no witnesses. `circuit` = ledger
> access + witnesses allowed. `export circuit` = same as `circuit` but callable
> from outside. The `export` keyword controls external visibility, not ledger
> access.

### 53. `receive` renamed to `receiveShielded`

The `receive()` function for accepting shielded coins was renamed. Using the old name produces:

```
apparent use of an old standard-library / ledger operator name receive:
    the new name is receiveShielded
```

Fix: `receiveShielded(disclose(coin))` where `coin` is a `ShieldedCoinInfo` parameter.

### 54. `sendImmediate` renamed to `sendImmediateShielded`

Same rename pattern:

```
apparent use of an old standard-library / ledger operator name sendImmediate:
    the new name is sendImmediateShielded
```

Fix: `sendImmediateShielded(disclose(coin), recipient, disclose(amount))`

### 55. `CoinInfo` type is actually `ShieldedCoinInfo`

The shielded coin descriptor type is `ShieldedCoinInfo`, not `CoinInfo`. It's a struct:

```compact
ShieldedCoinInfo<nonce: Bytes<32>, color: Bytes<32>, value: Uint<128>>
```

Access fields via `coin.nonce`, `coin.color`, `coin.value`.

### 56. `ownPublicKey()` is a stdlib built-in, not a witness

`ownPublicKey()` returns the caller's `ZswapCoinPublicKey` and is provided by `CompactStandardLibrary`. Declaring it as a witness causes a "call site ambiguity" error:

```
call site ambiguity (multiple compatible functions) in call to ownPublicKey
```

Fix: Remove the `witness ownPublicKey(): ZswapCoinPublicKey;` declaration. Just call `ownPublicKey()` directly.

### 57. `||` with witness-derived values triggers disclosure error

Using `||` (logical OR) in comparisons involving witness-derived hashes creates a short-circuit conditional branch that the compiler flags as a potential disclosure:

```
potential witness-value disclosure must be declared but is not
```

Fix: Restructure to avoid `||` with witness values. Use separate assertions or remove the auth check where it's not security-critical.

## Type System & Circuit Gotchas

### 58. `Counter.read() as Field as Bytes<32>` byte representation mismatch

`Counter.read()` returns a Field value. Casting `Field as Bytes<32>` produces the Field's internal byte representation (prime field element encoding), which does NOT match a naive `Uint8Array` construction in TypeScript.

```typescript
// TypeScript: manual byte construction
const seq = new Uint8Array(32);
seq[0] = 1;  // This is NOT the same as 1 as Field as Bytes<32>

// Using this in pureCircuits.myHash(sk, seq) will NOT match
// the in-circuit myHash(sk, counter.read() as Field as Bytes<32>)
```

If you pre-compute a hash off-chain using `pureCircuits.myFunction(sk, manualBytes)` and compare it against an in-circuit computation using `myFunction(sk, counter.read() as Field as Bytes<32>)`, the hashes will NOT match.

**Fix:** Either:
- Avoid using Counter values in hash inputs that need off-chain reproduction
- For per-contract-deployment patterns, skip the sequence counter in key derivation — the state machine prevents replays
- If you must use Counter in hashes, compute BOTH the storage AND the verification in-circuit (never pre-compute off-chain)

Discovered during LOKx LOK contract development (March 2026).

## Wallet & Transfer Gotchas

### 59. `transferTransaction` requires explicit `signRecipe` before submission

`WalletFacade.transferTransaction()` returns an `UnprovenTransactionRecipe` that is NOT signed. Calling `finalizeRecipe()` + `submitTransaction()` without signing produces **"Custom error: 139"** — the ledger rejects the unsigned transaction.

```typescript
// WRONG — error 139
const recipe = await wallet.transferTransaction([...], keys, { ttl });
const finalized = await wallet.finalizeRecipe(recipe);
await wallet.submitTransaction(finalized); // Custom error: 139

// CORRECT — sign before finalizing
const recipe = await wallet.transferTransaction([...], keys, { ttl });
const signed = await wallet.signRecipe(recipe, (payload) => keystore.signData(payload));
const finalized = await wallet.finalizeRecipe(signed);
await wallet.submitTransaction(finalized); // OK
```

This is surprising because contract deployments via `deployContract()` work without explicit signing — the SDK handles it internally via `balanceUnboundTransaction`. But `transferTransaction` uses a different code path (`UnprovenTransactionRecipe`) that requires the caller to sign explicitly.

The `transferTransaction` call takes `CombinedTokenTransfer[]`:

```typescript
const recipe = await wallet.transferTransaction(
  [{ type: "unshielded", outputs: [{ type: unshieldedToken().raw, receiverAddress: "mn_addr_preprod1...", amount: 100_000_000n }] }],
  { shieldedSecretKeys, dustSecretKey },
  { ttl: new Date(Date.now() + 30 * 60 * 1000), payFees: true },
);
```

**Error 138** (from `registerNightUtxosForDustGeneration`) means "already registered" — if your wallet generates DUST, registration is already done.

Discovered during LOKx tNight transfer on preprod (March 2026).

### 60. No balance-by-address query in the Midnight indexer

The Midnight preprod indexer GraphQL schema has no query for checking an address's token balance. The only way to check balances is through a full wallet SDK sync:

```typescript
const state = await Rx.firstValueFrom(wallet.state().pipe(Rx.filter(s => s.isSynced)));
const tNight = state.unshielded.balances[unshieldedToken().raw] ?? 0n;
const dust = state.dust.walletBalance(new Date());
```

This means you cannot check a third party's balance without their secret key. API designs that need balance checks must use the wallet SDK, not the indexer.

### 61. Shielded addresses use different bech32m format from unshielded

| Type | Format | Prefix | Data |
|------|--------|--------|------|
| Unshielded | `mn_addr_preprod1...` | `addr` | 32-byte address |
| Shielded | `mn_shield-addr_preprod1...` | `shield-addr` | 64-byte coinPk + encPk |

Construct a shielded address:

```typescript
import { ShieldedAddress, ShieldedCoinPublicKey, ShieldedEncryptionPublicKey, MidnightBech32m } from "@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-sdk-address-format";

const coinPkHex = state.shielded.state.publicKeys.coinPublicKey;  // hex string
const encPkHex = state.shielded.state.publicKeys.encryptionPublicKey;

const shAddr = new ShieldedAddress(
  new ShieldedCoinPublicKey(Buffer.from(coinPkHex, "hex")),
  new ShieldedEncryptionPublicKey(Buffer.from(encPkHex, "hex"))
);
const addrStr = MidnightBech32m.encode("preprod", shAddr).asString();
```

Note: `ShieldedAddress.toString()` returns `[object Object]` — use `.asString()` on the `MidnightBech32m` result, not `toString()` on the `ShieldedAddress` itself.

### 62. Multi-output unshielded transfers work

Multiple recipients in a single transaction:

```typescript
const recipe = await wallet.transferTransaction(
  [{
    type: "unshielded",
    outputs: [
      { type: unshieldedToken().raw, receiverAddress: addr1, amount: 1_000_000n },
      { type: unshieldedToken().raw, receiverAddress: addr2, amount: 1_000_000n },
    ],
  }],
  { shieldedSecretKeys, dustSecretKey },
  { ttl, payFees: true },
);
const signed = await wallet.signRecipe(recipe, signFn);  // Required (gotcha #59)
```

### 63. `initSwap` for shield conversion fails on preprod (error 138/109)

`wallet.initSwap()` for converting unshielded tNight to shielded tokens builds the recipe but submission fails:
- Error 138 without `payFees`
- Error 109 with `payFees: true`

This blocks shielded token operations for wallets that only hold unshielded tNight. May be a preprod limitation — needs investigation with the Midnight team.

**LOKx impact:** Contracts using `receiveShielded` need shielded inputs. If shield conversion doesn't work, the contract design should use unshielded operations instead (see gotcha #64).

---

## Token Operation Gotchas

### 64. Use `receiveUnshielded` / `sendUnshielded` for tNight operations

Compact provides **unshielded coin operations** that work with tNight (the token users actually hold). These are simpler than shielded operations — no `ShieldedCoinInfo` parameter needed, no coin descriptor tracking.

```compact
// Accept unshielded tokens into contract
receiveUnshielded(disclose(color), disclose(amount));

// Send unshielded tokens to a user address
sendUnshielded(color, amount, right<ContractAddress, UserAddress>(disclose(recipientAddr)));

// Send to another contract
sendUnshielded(color, amount, left<ContractAddress, UserAddress>(kernel.self()));

// Mint new unshielded tokens
mintUnshieldedToken(domainSep, value, right<ContractAddress, UserAddress>(disclose(recipient)));

// Check contract's unshielded balance
const bal = unshieldedBalance(color);
```

| | Shielded | Unshielded |
|---|---|---|
| Receive | `receiveShielded(coin: ShieldedCoinInfo)` | `receiveUnshielded(color: Bytes<32>, amount: Uint<128>)` |
| Send | `sendImmediateShielded(coin, recipient, amount)` | `sendUnshielded(color, amount, recipient)` |
| Recipient | `Either<ZswapCoinPublicKey, ContractAddress>` | `Either<ContractAddress, UserAddress>` |
| Balance check | N/A | `unshieldedBalance(color)` |
| Amount privacy | Hidden | Visible on-chain |

**When to use which:** Use unshielded for v0.1/PoC work where users hold tNight. Use shielded when privacy of amounts matters and users have shielded tokens (via minting or receiving).

**No `ownUserAddress()` built-in** — unlike `ownPublicKey()` for shielded, there's no way to get the caller's UserAddress inside a circuit. The caller must pass their `UserAddress` as a circuit parameter.

Discovered via midnight-mcp search across Midnight repos (March 2026).

### 65. `blockTimeGte` / `blockTimeLt` — protocol-enforced time checks

Compact provides protocol-enforced block time comparison functions. Unlike witness-based `getCurrentTime()`, these are validated by the **block producer** against the actual block timestamp — the caller cannot spoof them.

```compact
// Protocol-enforced: block producer validates against actual block time
assert(blockTimeGte(disclose(unlockTime)), "Not yet unlocked");
assert(blockTimeLt(disclose(deadline)), "Deadline passed");

// Returns Boolean — can be used in if/else too
if (blockTimeGt(disclose(someTime))) {
  // time has passed
}
```

| Function | Returns | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `blockTimeLt(time: Uint<64>)` | `Boolean` | Block time < time |
| `blockTimeLte(time: Uint<64>)` | `Boolean` | Block time <= time |
| `blockTimeGt(time: Uint<64>)` | `Boolean` | Block time > time |
| `blockTimeGte(time: Uint<64>)` | `Boolean` | Block time >= time |

The `time` parameter is in **seconds since Unix epoch** (Uint<64>).

**Simulator limitation:** `blockTimeGt/Gte/Lt/Lte` are not enforced in the `compact-runtime` simulator — they pass through without validation. Time enforcement only works on-chain. Test time-dependent logic on preprod, not in the simulator.

**On-chain enforcement confirmed (March 2026):** `assert(blockTimeGte(futureTime))` rejects the transaction with "failed assert: Too early". The ZK proof fails to validate against the block producer's timestamp. Ledger state is NOT updated on rejection (transaction atomicity preserved). `blockTimeGte(pastTime)` succeeds and updates state normally.

**Key behaviour:** `blockTimeGte` returns `Boolean`, not void. Used standalone, it returns true/false without rejecting. Wrap in `assert()` to enforce: `assert(blockTimeGte(unlockTime), "Too early")`.

**DUST cost:** Both successful and failed `callTx` cost DUST (~400-500B). Failed assertions consume the proof generation cost but do not update ledger state.

**Use instead of witness-based time:** For any time-gated operation (locks, deadlines, vesting), prefer `blockTimeGte` over a `getCurrentTime()` witness. The witness approach lets callers lie about the time; `blockTimeGte` cannot be spoofed.

Discovered via midnight-mcp search (March 2026). Working examples in `compact-export/test-center/compact/block-time.compact`.

## Advanced Compact Features

### 66. `sealed ledger` — private ledger fields

The `sealed` keyword makes a ledger field private — only the contract can read/write it, and the value is not visible on-chain.

```compact
export sealed ledger secretConfig: Bytes<32>;    // private, only contract sees it
export ledger publicCounter: Counter;             // public, anyone can read via indexer
```

`sealed` fields are encrypted in the contract state. Use for sensitive configuration that should be set once and never exposed. Seen in the Midnames DID contract (`midnames/core`).

**Note:** `sealed` + `export` means the field exists in the contract's type signature (the SDK knows about it) but the value is private on-chain.

### 67. `MerkleTree` and `HistoricMerkleTree` ledger types

Compact supports Merkle trees as native ledger types with built-in proof verification.

```compact
ledger commitments: MerkleTree<10, Bytes<32>>;           // depth 10, Bytes<32> values
ledger history: HistoricMerkleTree<32, Bytes<32>>;       // preserves past roots

// Insert
commitments.insertHash(hash);
commitments.insertIndex(value, index);

// Verify proof path
const digest = merkleTreePathRoot<10, Bytes<32>>(path);
assert(commitments.checkRoot(digest), "Invalid proof");
```

`HistoricMerkleTree` preserves previous roots so old proofs remain valid after new insertions. The `MerkleTreePath` type is used as a circuit parameter for proof verification.

Useful for scalable membership proofs, commitment schemes, and privacy-preserving registries.

### 68. Cross-contract calls via `kernel.claimContractCall`

Compact supports composable cross-contract interaction via kernel claims:

```compact
// Claim a call to another contract's circuit
kernel.claimContractCall(contractAddr, entryPointHash, transientCommitment);

// The called contract must independently verify the claim
// This is NOT a direct function call — it's a commitment-based protocol
```

The pattern uses `transientCommit` to create a commitment to data that the called contract can verify. Both contracts must be in the same transaction for the claim to be validated.

**Contract type declarations in modules:**

```compact
module Protocol {
  contract TokenContract {
    circuit transfer(to: UserAddress, amount: Uint<128>): [];
  }
}

import Protocol prefix P_;
export ledger token: P_TokenContract;
```

This allows one contract to reference another's type at the ledger level. Cross-contract interaction is still commitment-based, not direct calls.

---

## Ecosystem Limitations (March 2026)

### 69. Wallet → contract token transfers not yet implemented in SDK (March 2026)

**This is the most significant ecosystem limitation.** As of midnight-js v3.2.0 and wallet-sdk v2.0.0 (both March 2026), the SDK does not support transferring tokens from a wallet into a contract via `receiveUnshielded` or `receiveShielded`.

Midnight's own test suite confirms this:

```
test.skip('should receive tokens from wallet')     // unshielded — skipped
test.todo('should transfer night from wallet to contract')  // unshielded — not implemented
// receiveShielded from wallet — no test exists
```

**What works:**

| Operation | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Contract → wallet (unshielded) | **Works** | Confirmed on-chain (gotcha #73) |
| Contract → wallet (shielded) | Works | `sendImmediateShielded` validated |
| Wallet → wallet (unshielded) | Works | Requires `signRecipe` (gotcha #59) |
| Wallet → wallet (shielded) | Works | If user has shielded tokens |
| Contract self-mint + receive | **Fails via callTx** | SDK wallet balancer intercepts (gotcha #72) |
| **Wallet → contract (unshielded)** | **Not implemented** | `receiveUnshielded` compiles but SDK can't build the TX |
| **Wallet → contract (shielded)** | **Not implemented** | `receiveShielded` compiles but no SDK path exists |

**Impact:** Any contract that accepts tokens from users (`receiveUnshielded` or `receiveShielded`) will compile and pass simulator tests, but **will fail on-chain with error 139** because the SDK's transaction builder doesn't include wallet UTxOs as inputs when calling contract circuits.

**Workarounds:**
- Contracts can mint their own tokens (`mintUnshieldedToken` / `mintShieldedToken`) and manage them internally
- Contract-to-wallet sends work (`sendUnshielded` / `sendImmediateShielded`)
- API-layer custody: the API holds tokens and tracks lock state in a database, calling the contract for ZK condition verification only

**For contract developers:** Your `receiveUnshielded`/`receiveShielded` code is correct. The limitation is in the off-chain SDK, not the Compact language or the on-chain runtime. When Midnight implements wallet→contract transfers, your contracts will work without changes.

Confirmed against midnight-js v3.2.0 (2026-03-11) and wallet-sdk v2.0.0 (2026-03-10). Verified via midnight-mcp search across all Midnight repos.

**UPDATE (2026-03-18): Fix confirmed in Compact 0.30.0 / Ledger 8.0.2.** Compact Issue #151 ("Circuit call fails when using `sendUnshielded` and `receiveUnshielded`") is listed in the 0.30.0 fixed defect list (released 2026-03-17). Preview network has been upgraded to v8. Preprod upgrade pending. When preprod moves to v8, wallet→contract transfers should work. LOK contract compiles and passes tests on 0.30.0 with zero code changes.

**Ledger spec confirms protocol support (March 2026):**

The midnight-ledger spec (`spec/contracts.md`, `spec/night.md`) confirms that wallet→contract unshielded transfers ARE supported at the protocol level:

- `Effects.unshielded_inputs: Map<TokenType, u128>` — contracts declare expected unshielded inputs. The ledger validates that matching UTXO spends are present in the transaction.
- `ContractState.balance: Map<TokenType, u128>` — contracts maintain token balances at the ledger level.
- `CallContext.balance: Map<TokenType, u128>` — contracts can query their own balance during execution.

The gap is purely in the SDK transaction builder (`midnight-js`), which does not read the contract's `Effects.unshielded_inputs` and automatically include wallet UTxOs to satisfy them. The ledger would accept the transaction if properly constructed.

Ledger 8.0.1 also adds `last_block_time: Timestamp` to `CallContext` — confirming `blockTimeGte` is backed by the ledger runtime, not just the circuit compiler.

### 70. `callTx` works for non-token circuits, `callQry` does not exist on deployed contracts

Post-deployment circuit calls via `deployed.callTx.circuitName()` work on-chain for circuits that don't involve token operations. Each call generates a ZK proof and submits a transaction (~20s).

However, `deployed.callQry` does not exist — off-chain queries must use the indexer directly:

```typescript
// ON-CHAIN call (works, costs DUST, ~20s)
const result = await deployed.callTx.queryState();
console.log(result.private?.result); // circuit return value

// OFF-CHAIN state read (works, free, instant)
const contractState = await providers.publicDataProvider.queryContractState(contractAddress);
const ledgerState = mod.ledger(contractState.data);
console.log(ledgerState.state); // read any public ledger field
```

### 71. `mintUnshieldedToken` to UserAddress delivers tokens to wallet

Minting custom unshielded tokens directly to a user's wallet works on-chain:

```compact
export circuit mintToUser(domainSep: Bytes<32>, amount: Uint<64>, recipient: UserAddress): Bytes<32> {
  return mintUnshieldedToken(disclose(domainSep), disclose(amount), right<ContractAddress, UserAddress>(disclose(recipient)));
}
```

The recipient's wallet shows the new token type in `state.unshielded.balances[tokenColor]` alongside tNight. Each contract+domain combination produces a unique token color.

TypeScript: pass UserAddress as `{ bytes: Buffer.from(addressHex, "hex") }`.

### 72. `receiveUnshielded` fails via `callTx` even for self-minted tokens

`receiveUnshielded` in a circuit called via `callTx` triggers "Insufficient funds" — even when the tokens were minted to the contract in the same circuit. The wallet SDK's transaction balancer sees the `receiveUnshielded` claim and tries to satisfy it from wallet UTxOs, which don't have the custom token.

```compact
// This FAILS on-chain via callTx (Insufficient funds)
export circuit mintAndReceive(domainSep: Bytes<32>, amount: Uint<64>): Bytes<32> {
  const color = mintUnshieldedToken(domainSep, amount, left<ContractAddress, UserAddress>(kernel.self()));
  receiveUnshielded(color, amount as Uint<128>);  // SDK tries to balance from wallet
  return color;
}

// This WORKS — mint directly to user instead
export circuit mintToUser(domainSep: Bytes<32>, amount: Uint<64>, recipient: UserAddress): Bytes<32> {
  return mintUnshieldedToken(domainSep, amount, right<ContractAddress, UserAddress>(disclose(recipient)));
}
```

This is related to gotcha #69 (wallet→contract transfers not implemented). The `receiveUnshielded` claim always triggers wallet-side balancing regardless of where the tokens originate.

### 73. `sendUnshielded` from contract to wallet works on-chain

Contracts can send unshielded tokens to user wallets via `callTx`:

```compact
export circuit sendToUser(color: Bytes<32>, amount: Uint<128>, recipient: UserAddress): [] {
  sendUnshielded(disclose(color), disclose(amount), right<ContractAddress, UserAddress>(disclose(recipient)));
}
```

This confirms the outbound token path works. Combined with `mintUnshieldedToken` (gotcha #71), contracts can create and distribute tokens. Only the inbound path (wallet→contract) remains blocked (gotcha #69).

### 74. Migrating from Ledger v7 to v8 (Compact 0.29→0.30)

Compact 0.30.0 targets Ledger v8. Contracts compiled for v7 will NOT work on v8 networks. Ledger v7 is officially unsupported as of March 2026.

**Compiler:** Install via `compact self update` then `compact update 0.30.0`. Check with `compact compile --ledger-version` → `ledger-8.0.2`.

**Breaking changes:** `NativePoint` → `JubjubPoint` (use `compact fixup` to auto-rename). `persistentHash`/`persistentCommit` on `Opaque` values is now a compiler error.

**Official v8 compatibility matrix (from docs.midnight.network/relnotes/overview, March 2026):**

| Component | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| Ledger | 8.0.3 |
| Proof Server | 8.0.3 |
| Compact Runtime | 0.15.0 |
| Compact Compiler (compactc) | 0.30.0 |
| Compact Toolchain (compact) | 0.5.1 |
| Compact JS | 2.5.0 |
| Indexer | 4.0.1 |
| Midnight.js | 4.0.2 |
| Wallet SDK Facade | 3.0.0 |
| DApp Connector API | 4.0.1 |

**Note:** The official counter example (midnightntwrk/example-counter) still uses older versions (midnight-js 3.0.0, wallet-sdk-facade 1.0.0, compact-runtime 0.14.0, ledger-v7 imports). Both version sets work on the v8 network. The compatibility matrix versions are the officially recommended ones.

**WalletFacade construction:**

```typescript
// 3-arg constructor (works with wallet-sdk-facade 1.0.0 and 3.0.0)
const wallet = new WalletFacade(shieldedWallet, unshieldedWallet, dustWallet);
await wallet.start(shieldedSecretKeys, dustSecretKey);
```

The constructor takes three sub-wallets (ShieldedWallet, UnshieldedWallet, DustWallet), each configured independently. See offchain.md for full setup pattern.

**Proof server:** Docker `midnightntwrk/proof-server:8.0.3`. The `--network` flag is no longer accepted. Run: `docker run -d -p 6300:6300 midnightntwrk/proof-server:8.0.3 midnight-proof-server --port 6300`. Remote proof servers via Lace are currently unavailable — run locally.

**Key fix:** Issue #151 (`sendUnshielded`/`receiveUnshielded` circuit call failures) is resolved. Wallet→contract unshielded transfers work on v8.

**Version mismatch errors:** Deploying a v8-compiled contract via v7 SDK gives "expected instance of ContractMaintenanceAuthority". Deploying a v7-compiled contract with v8 compact-runtime gives "Version mismatch: compiled code expects 0.14.0, runtime is 0.15.0". Always match: compiler version → runtime version → network ledger version.

### 75. Dust Registration Required Before Contract Interaction

NIGHT tokens generate DUST (the fee token) over time, but only after UTxOs are explicitly registered for dust generation via an on-chain transaction. Without DUST, all contract deployments and circuit calls fail with `Wallet.InsufficientFunds: could not balance dust`.

Registration flow:

```typescript
const state = await Rx.firstValueFrom(wallet.state().pipe(Rx.filter((s) => s.isSynced)));

// 1. Check if dust already available
if (state.dust.availableCoins.length > 0 && state.dust.walletBalance(new Date()) > 0n) return;

// 2. Filter unregistered NIGHT coins
const nightUtxos = state.unshielded.availableCoins.filter(
  (coin) => coin.meta?.registeredForDustGeneration !== true,
);

// 3. Register
if (nightUtxos.length > 0) {
  const recipe = await wallet.registerNightUtxosForDustGeneration(
    nightUtxos, unshieldedKeystore.getPublicKey(),
    (payload) => unshieldedKeystore.signData(payload),
  );
  const finalized = await wallet.finalizeRecipe(recipe);
  await wallet.submitTransaction(finalized);
}

// 4. Wait for dust to accrue
await Rx.firstValueFrom(wallet.state().pipe(
  Rx.throttleTime(5_000),
  Rx.filter((s) => s.isSynced && s.dust.walletBalance(new Date()) > 0n),
));
```

DUST economics: 5 DUST per NIGHT, ~1 week to reach cap, 3-hour grace period after backing NIGHT is spent.

**Facade version differences:** The dust balance check above uses the facade 1.0.0 API (`s.dust.walletBalance`). In facade 3.0.0 the path is `s.dust.state.state.walletBalance(new Date())` (WASM object).

**Known issue:** If a transaction fails after DUST is allocated for balancing, the DUST coins become stuck in a "pending" state. Restart the wallet to recover them.

**Note:** In facade 3.0.0, `WalletFacade.init()` requires `ledger-v8` for `ZswapSecretKeys.fromSeed()` and `DustSecretKey.fromSeed()` — using `ledger-v7` types causes "expected instance of DustParameters".

### 76. signRecipe Bug — Failed to Clone Intent

`wallet.signRecipe()` has a known bug: it hardcodes `'pre-proof'` as the proof marker when cloning intents via `Intent.deserialize()`. This works for `UnprovenTransaction` (which has `PreProof` intents) but fails for `UnboundTransaction` (which has `Proof` intents after proving). The error is "Failed to clone intent".

**Workaround:** Bypass `signRecipe()` and sign manually with correct proof markers:

```typescript
const signTransactionIntents = (tx, signFn, proofMarker) => {
  if (!tx.intents || tx.intents.size === 0) return;
  for (const segment of tx.intents.keys()) {
    const intent = tx.intents.get(segment);
    if (!intent) continue;
    const cloned = ledger.Intent.deserialize('signature', proofMarker, 'pre-binding', intent.serialize());
    const sigData = cloned.signatureData(segment);
    const signature = signFn(sigData);
    if (cloned.fallibleUnshieldedOffer) {
      const sigs = cloned.fallibleUnshieldedOffer.inputs.map(
        (_, i) => cloned.fallibleUnshieldedOffer.signatures.at(i) ?? signature);
      cloned.fallibleUnshieldedOffer = cloned.fallibleUnshieldedOffer.addSignatures(sigs);
    }
    if (cloned.guaranteedUnshieldedOffer) {
      const sigs = cloned.guaranteedUnshieldedOffer.inputs.map(
        (_, i) => cloned.guaranteedUnshieldedOffer.signatures.at(i) ?? signature);
      cloned.guaranteedUnshieldedOffer = cloned.guaranteedUnshieldedOffer.addSignatures(sigs);
    }
    tx.intents.set(segment, cloned);
  }
};

// In balanceTx:
const recipe = await wallet.balanceUnboundTransaction(tx, keys, { ttl });
signTransactionIntents(recipe.baseTransaction, signFn, 'proof');        // proven tx
signTransactionIntents(recipe.balancingTransaction, signFn, 'pre-proof'); // wallet-created
return wallet.finalizeRecipe(recipe);
```

This bug is in `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-sdk-unshielded-wallet` (`TransactionOps.ts`). **Update (March 2026):** `wallet.signRecipe()` works correctly in wallet-sdk-facade 3.0.0 — the bug appears to be fixed. On-chain validated with `receiveUnshielded` on v8 preprod. The manual workaround is only needed for facade 1.0.0.

### 77. Wrong Token Type Shows Zero Balance

The wallet shows zero balance despite receiving funds if you use the wrong token type for balance lookup.

```typescript
// WRONG — nativeToken() returns 68-char tagged hex (02000000...0000)
import { nativeToken } from '@midnight-ntwrk/ledger';
const balance = state.unshielded.balances[nativeToken()]; // always undefined

// CORRECT — unshieldedToken().raw returns 64-char raw hex (0000...0000)
import { unshieldedToken } from '@midnight-ntwrk/ledger-v7';
const balance = state.unshielded.balances[unshieldedToken().raw]; // actual balance
```

**Debugging tip:** If wallet shows `isSynced: true` but zero balance, log `Object.keys(state.unshielded.balances)` and compare key lengths. 64-char = correct (ledger-v7). 68-char = wrong (old ledger v4).

### 78. levelPrivateStateProvider Requires Encryption Config

Since midnight-js 3.0.0, `levelPrivateStateProvider` requires encryption configuration. Passing neither `walletProvider` nor `privateStoragePasswordProvider` throws at runtime:

```
Either privateStoragePasswordProvider or walletProvider must be provided
```

Provide exactly ONE of:

```typescript
// Recommended — uses wallet's encryption public key
levelPrivateStateProvider({
  privateStateStoreName: 'myStore',
  walletProvider: walletAndMidnightProvider,
});

// Alternative — custom password (minimum 16 characters)
levelPrivateStateProvider({
  privateStateStoreName: 'myStore',
  privateStoragePasswordProvider: () => 'min-16-char-password',
});
```

Providing BOTH also throws an error.

**WARNING:** `levelPrivateStateProvider` has no recovery mechanism. Clearing browser cache or deleting local files permanently destroys private state.

### 79. Simulator API Changed in compact-runtime 0.15.0

The simulator API changed significantly in compact-runtime 0.15.0 (Compact 0.30.0). All 29 skill examples validated on the new API.

**Constructor invocation:**

```typescript
// Old (0.14.0)
const ctx = createConstructorContext(contractAddress, zswapLocalState, ...constructorArgs);
const result = contract.constructor(ctx);
// result.currentContractState, result.currentPrivateState, result.currentZswapLocalState

// New (0.15.0)
const ctx = createConstructorContext(initialPrivateState, coinPublicKey);
const result = contract.initialState(ctx, ...constructorArgs);
// result.currentContractState, result.currentPrivateState, result.currentZswapLocalState
```

Key changes: constructor args go to `initialState()`, not `createConstructorContext()`. The context factory takes `(privateState, coinPubKey)` instead of `(addr, zswap)`.

**Witness return format:**

```typescript
// Old (0.14.0) — return just the value
localSecretKey: (witnessContext) => mySecretKey,

// New (0.15.0) — return [nextPrivateState, value] tuple
localSecretKey: (witnessContext) => [witnessContext.privateState, mySecretKey],
```

**Circuit result access:**

```typescript
// Old (0.14.0)
const result = contract.impureCircuits.increment(ctx);
const ledgerState = mod.ledger(result.currentContractState);

// New (0.15.0)
const result = contract.impureCircuits.increment(ctx);
const ledgerState = mod.ledger(result.context.currentQueryContext.state);
// Chain state: result.context (use as next circuit's context)
```

**Circuit context creation remains 4-arg** (with 3 optional):
`createCircuitContext(contractAddress, zswapLocalState, contractState, privateState, gasLimit?, costModel?, time?)`

## Version Compatibility

> **WARNING:** Midnight is pre-mainnet software. APIs, syntax, and tooling
> change between versions. The gotchas above were confirmed from early 2025
> through March 2026 (Compact toolchain 0.25.x-0.30.x range). The v8 release
> (Ledger 8.0.3, March 2026) is the current target for both Preview and PreProd.
> Always check the latest release
> notes, as some of these issues may be fixed in newer versions.

**The golden rule:** When something isn't working, check this list first,
then check the version compatibility matrix, then ask in Discord.
